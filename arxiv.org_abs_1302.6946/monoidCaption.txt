Given x, a character position, consider the following. We know that x is a
character position, which when moved up results in a character position, which
when moved down results in a character position that we’ll call P(x). We also
know that x is a character position that we’ll call Q(x). Fact: whenever x is a
character position we will have P(x)=Q(x). Summary: [up, down] = [ ]

Given x, a character position, consider the following. We know that x is a
character position, which when moved up results in a character position, which
when moved right results in a character position that we’ll call P(x). We also
know that x is a character position, which when moved right results in a
character position, which when moved up results in a character position that
we’ll call Q(x). Fact: whenever x is a character position we will have P(x)=Q(x).
Summary: [up, right] = [right, up]
