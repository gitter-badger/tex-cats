\section{\caseENGRUS{Graphs}{ / }{Графы}}\label{sec:graphs}

\begin{blockENG}
In this course, unless otherwise specified, whenever we speak of graphs we are not talking about curves in the plane, such as parabolas, or pictures of functions generally. We are speaking of systems of vertices and arrows.
\end{blockENG}

\begin{blockRUS}
\end{blockRUS}

\begin{blockENG}
We will take our graphs to be {\em directed}, meaning that every arrow points {\em from} a vertex {\em to} a vertex; rather than merely connecting vertices, arrows will have direction. If $a$ and $b$ are vertices, there can be many arrows from $a$ to $b$, or none at all. There can be arrows from $a$ to itself. Here is the formal definition in terms of sets and functions.

\begin{definitionENG}\label{def:graph}\index{graph}
A {\em graph} $G$ consists of a sequence $G:=(V,A,src,tgt)$ where 
\begin{itemize}
\item $V$ is a set, called {\em the set of vertices of $G$} (singular:{\em vertex}),\index{vertex}
\item $A$ is a set, called {\em the set of arrows of $G$},\index{arrow}
\item $src\taking A\to V$ is a function, called {\em the source function for $G$}, and
\item $tgt\taking A\to V$ is a function, called {\em the target function for $G$}.
\end{itemize}
Given an arrow $a\in A$ we refer to $src(a)$ as the {\em source vertex} of $a$ and to $tgt(a)$ as the {\em target vertex} of $a$.
\end{definitionENG}

\begin{definitionRUS}\label{def:graph}\index{graph}
\end{definitionRUS}

\begin{blockENG}
To draw a graph, first draw a dot for every element of $V$. Then for every element $a\in A$, draw an arrow connecting dot $src(a)$ to dot $tgt(a)$.
\end{blockENG}

\begin{blockRUS}
\end{blockRUS}

\begin{exampleENG}[Graph]\label{ex:graph}
Here is a picture of a graph $G=(V,A,src,tgt)$:
\begin{align}\label{dia:graph}
G:=\parbox{2in}{\fbox{\xymatrix{\bullet^v\ar[r]^f&\bullet^w\ar@/_1pc/[r]_h\ar@/^1pc/[r]^g&\bullet^x\\\bullet^y\ar@(l,u)[]^i\ar@/^1pc/[r]^j&\bullet^z\ar@/^1pc/[l]^k}}}
\end{align} 
We have $V=\{v,w,x,y,z\}$ and $A=\{f,g,h,i,j,k\}$. The source and target functions $src,tgt\taking A\to V$ can be captured in the table to the left below:
\begin{align*}
\begin{array}{| l || l | l |}\bhline
{\bf A}&{\bf src}&{\bf tgt}\\\bbhline
f&v&w\\\hline
g&w&x\\\hline
h&w&x\\\hline
i&y&y\\\hline
j&y&z\\\hline
k&z&y\\\bhline
\end{array}
\hspace{1in}
\begin{array}{| l |}\bhline
{\bf V}\\\bbhline
v\\\hline
w\\\hline
x\\\hline
y\\\hline
z\\\bhline
\end{array}
\end{align*}
In fact, all of the data of the graph $G$ is captured in the two tables above—together they tell us the sets $A$ and $V$ and the functions $src$ and $tgt$.
\end{exampleENG}

\begin{exampleRUS}[Graph]\label{ex:graph}
\end{exampleRUS}

\begin{exampleENG}
Every olog has an underlying graph. The additional information in an olog has to do with which pairs of paths are declared equivalent, as well as text that has certain English-readability rules.\index{olog!underlying graph}
\end{exampleENG}

\begin{exampleRUS}
\end{exampleRUS}

\begin{exerciseENG}
\sexc Draw the graph corresponding to the following tables:
\begin{align*}
\begin{array}{| l || l | l |}\bhline
{\bf A}&{\bf src}&{\bf tgt}\\\bbhline

\item Write down two tables, as above, corresponding to the following graph:
$$\fbox{\xymatrix{

$$

\begin{exerciseRUS}
\end{exerciseRUS}

\begin{exerciseENG}
Let $A=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ and $B=\{a,b,c\}$. Draw them and choose an arbitrary function $f\taking A\to B$ and draw it. Let $A\sqcup B$ be the coproduct of $A$ and $B$ (Definition~\ref{def:coproduct}) and let $A\To{i_1}A\sqcup B\From{i_2}B$ be the two inclusions. Consider the two functions $src,tgt\taking A\to A\sqcup B$, where $src=i_1$ and $tgt$ is the composition $A\To{f}B\To{i_2}A\sqcup B$. Draw the associated graph $(A\sqcup B,A,src,tgt)$.
\end{exerciseENG}

\begin{exerciseRUS}
\end{exerciseRUS}

\begin{exerciseENG}~
\sexc Let $V$ be a set. Suppose we just draw the elements of $V$ as vertices and have no arrows between them. Is this a graph?
\item Given $V$, is there any other “canonical” or somehow automatic non-random procedure for generating a graph with those vertices? 
\endsexc
\end{exerciseENG}

\begin{exerciseRUS}~
\end{exerciseRUS}

\begin{exampleENG}
Recall from Construction~\ref{const:bipartite} the notion of bipartite graph, which we defined to be a span (i.e. pair of functions, see Definition~\ref{def:span}) $A\From{f}R\To{g}B$. Now that we have a formal definition of graph, we might hope that bipartite graphs fit in, and they do. Let $V=A\sqcup B$ and let $i\taking A\to V$ and $j\taking B\to V$ be the inclusions. Let $src=i\circ f\taking R\to V$ and let $tgt=j\circ g\taking R\to V$ be the composites.
$$
\xymatrix{&A\ar[dr]^i\\R\ar@/^1pc/[rr]_{src}\ar@/_1pc/[rr]^{tgt}\ar[ur]^f\ar[dr]_g&&V\\&B\ar[ur]_j}
$$ 
Then $(V,R,src,tgt)$ is a graph that would be drawn exactly as we specified the drawing of spans in Construction~\ref{const:bipartite}.
\end{exampleENG}

\begin{exampleRUS}
\end{exampleRUS}

\begin{exampleENG}\label{ex:[n] as graph}
Let $n\in\NN$ be a natural number. The {\em chain graph of length $n$},\index{graph!chain} denoted $[n]$ is the graph depicted here:
$$
\xymatrix{
\LMO{0}\ar[r]&\LMO{1}\ar[r]&\cdots\ar[r]&\LMO{n}
}
$$
In general $[n]$ has $n$ arrows and $n+1$ vertices. In particular, when $n=0$ we have that $[0]$ is the graph consisting of a single vertex and no arrows. 
\end{exampleENG}

\begin{exampleRUS}\label{ex:[n] as graph}
\end{exampleRUS}

\begin{exampleENG}\label{ex:ZxG}
Let $G=(V,A,src,tgt)$ be a graph; we want to spread it out over discrete time, so that each arrow does not occur within a given time-slice but instead over a quantum unit of time. 

Let $N=(\NN,\NN,n\mapsto n,n\mapsto n+1)$ be the graph depicted 
$$\xymatrix{\LMO{0}\ar[r]^0&\LMO{1}\ar[r]^1&\LMO{2}\ar[r]^2&\cdots}$$
When we get to limits in a category, we will understand that products can be taken in the category of graphs (see  Example~\ref{ex:product of graphs}), and $N\times G$ will make sense. For now, we construct it by hand.

Let $T(G)=(V\times \NN,A\times\NN,src',tgt')$ be a new graph, where for $a\in A$ and $n\in\NN$ we have $src'(a,n):=(src(a),n)$ and $tgt'(a,n)=(tgt(a),n+1)$. This may be a bit much to swallow, so try to simply understand what is being done in the following example. 

Let $G$ be the graph drawn below 
$$\xymatrix{\LMO{a}\ar@(ul,ur)[]^f\ar[d]_g\\\LMO{b}}$$
Then $T(G)$ will be the graph 
$$\xymatrix@=30pt{
\LMO{a0}\ar[r]^{f0}\ar[rd]_{g0}&\LMO{a1}\ar[r]^{f1}\ar[rd]_{g1}&\LMO{a2}\ar[r]^{f2}\ar[rd]_{g2}&\cdots\\
\LMO{b0}&\LMO{b1}&\LMO{b2}&\cdots
}
$$
As you can see, $f$-arrows still take $a$'s to $a$'s and $g$-arrows still take $a$'s to $b$'s, but they always march forward in time.

Draw (using ellipses “$\cdots$” if necessary) the graph $T(G)$ defined in Example~\ref{ex:ZxG}.

A graph is a pair of functions $A\tto V$. This sets up the notion of equalizer and coequalizer (see Definitions~\ref{def:equalizer} and~\ref{def:coequalizer}).

\subsection{\caseENGRUS{Paths in a graph}{ / }{Пути в графе}}\label{sec:paths in graph}

\begin{blockENG}
We all know what a path in a graph is, especially if we understand that a path must always follow the direction of arrows. The following definition makes this idea precise. In particular, one can have paths of any finite length $n\in\NN$, even length $0$ or $1$. Also, we want to be able to talk about the source vertex and target vertex of a path, as well as concatenation of paths.
\end{blockENG}

\begin{definitionENG}\label{def:paths in graph}\index{graph!paths}
Let $G=(V,A,src,tgt)$ be a graph. A {\em path of length $n$}\index{path} in $G$, denoted $p\in\Path_G^{(n)}$\index{a symbol!$\Path$} is a head-to-tail sequence \begin{align}\label{dia:path}p=(v_0\To{a_1}v_1\To{a_2}v_2\To{a_3}\ldots\To{a_n}v_n)\end{align} of arrows in $G$, which we denote by $v_0 a_1 a_2 \ldots a_n$. In particular we have canonical isomorphisms $\Path_G^{(1)}\iso A$ and $\Path_G^{(0)}\iso V$; we refer to the path of length 0 on vertex $v$ as the {\em trivial path on $v$} and denote it simply by $v$. We denote by $\Path_G$ the set of paths in $G$, $$\Path_G:=\bigcup_{n\in\NN}\Path_G^{(n)}.$$ Every path $p\in\Path_G$ has a source vertex and a target vertex, and we may denote these by $\ol{src},\ol{tgt}\taking\Path_G\to V$. If $p$ is a path with $\ol{src}(p)=v$ and $\ol{tgt}(p)=w$, we may denote it by $p\taking v\to w$. Given two vertices $v,w\in V$, we write $\Path_G(v,w)$ to denote the set of all paths $p\taking v\to w$.

There is a concatenation operation on paths.\index{concatenation!of paths} Given a path $p\taking v\to w$ and $q\taking w\to x$, we define the concatenation, denoted $p q\taking v\to x$ in the obvious way. If $p=va_1,a_2\ldots a_m$ and $q= wb_1b_2\ldots b_n$ then $pq=va_1\ldots a_mb_1\ldots b_n.$ In particular, if $p$ (resp. $r$) is the trivial path on vertex $v$ (resp. vertex $w$) then for any path $q\taking v\to w$, we have $pq=q$ (resp. $qr=q$). 
\end{definitionENG}

\begin{definitionRUS}\label{def:paths in graph}\index{граф!пути}
\end{definitionRUS}

\begin{exampleENG}
In Diagram (\ref{dia:graph}), page \pageref{dia:graph}, there are no paths from $v$ to $y$, one path ($f$) from $v$ to $w$, two paths ($fg$ and $fh$) from $v$ to $x$, and infinitely many paths $$\{y i^{p_1}(jk)^{q_1}\cdots i^{p_n}(jk)^{q_n}\;|\;n,p_1,q_1,\ldots,p_n,q_n\in\NN\}$$ from $y$ to $y$. There are other paths as well, including the five trivial paths.

\subsection{\caseENGRUS{Graph homomorphisms}{ / }{Гомоморфизмы графов}}

\begin{blockENG}
A graph $(V,A,src,tgt)$ involves two sets and two functions. For two graphs to be comparable, their two sets and their two functions should be appropriately comparable.\index{appropriate comparison}
\end{blockENG}

\begin{blockRUS}
\end{blockRUS}

\begin{definitionENG}\label{def:graph homomorphism}\index{graph!homomorphism}
Let $G=(V,A,src,tgt)$ and $G'=(V',A',src',tgt')$ be graphs. A {\em graph homomorphism $f$ from $G$ to $G'$}, denoted $f\taking G\to G'$, consists of two functions $f_0\taking V\to V'$ and $f_1\taking A\to A'$ such that the two diagrams below commute:
\begin{align}\label{dia:graph hom}
\xymatrix{A\ar[r]^{f_1}\ar[d]_{src}&A'\ar[d]^{src'}\\V\ar[r]_{f_0}&V'
}\hspace{1in}
\xymatrix{A\ar[r]^{f_1}\ar[d]_{tgt}&A'\ar[d]^{tgt'}\\V\ar[r]_{f_0}&V'
}
\end{align}
\end{definitionENG}

\begin{definitionRUS}\label{def:graph homomorphism}\index{graph!homomorphism}
\end{definitionRUS}

\begin{remarkENG}
The above conditions (\ref{dia:graph hom}) may look abstruse at first, but they encode a very important idea, roughly stated “arrows are bound to their vertices”. Under a map of graphs $G\to G'$ , one cannot flippantly send an arrow of $G$ any old arrow of $G'$: it must still connect the vertices it connected before. Below is an example of a mapping that does not respect this condition: $a$ connects $1$ and $2$ before, but not after:
$$
\fbox{\xymatrix{\LMO{\color{red}{1}}\ar[r]^{a}&\LMO{\color{blue}{2}}}}
\xymatrix{~\ar[rr]^{1\mapsto 1',2\mapsto 2', a\mapsto a'}&\hsp&~}
\fbox{\xymatrix{\LMO{\color{red}{1'}}&\LMO{\color{blue}{2'}}\ar[r]^{a'}&\LMO{\color{ForestGreen}{3'}}}}
$$
The commutativity of the diagrams in (\ref{dia:graph hom}) is exactly what is needed to ensure that arrows are handled in the expected way by a proposed graph homomorphism.
\end{remarkENG}

\begin{remarkRUS}
\end{remarkRUS}

\begin{exampleENG}[Graph homomorphism]\label{ex:graph hom}
Let $G=(V,A,src,tgt)$ and $G'=(V',A',src',tgt')$ be the graphs drawn to the left and right (respectively) below:
\begin{align}\label{dia:graph hom example}
\parbox{1.5in}{\fbox{\xymatrix{\LMO{\color{red}{1}}\ar[r]^a\ar@/^1pc/[d]^d\ar@/_1pc/[d]_c&\LMO{\color{ForestGreen}{2}}\ar[r]^b&\LMO{\color{red}{3}}\\\LMO{4}&\LMO{\color{blue}{5}}\ar[r]^e&\LMO{\color{blue}{6}}}}}

\end{align}
The colors indicate our choice of function $f_0\taking V\to V'$. Given that choice, condition (\ref{dia:graph hom}) imposes in this case that there is a unique choice of graph homomorphism $f\taking G\to G'$.

More precisely, is there always an isomorphism between the set of graph homomorphisms $[n]\to G$ and the set $\Path_G^{(n)}$ of length-$n$ paths in $G$?

\item Suppose that $f_0$ and $f_1$ are injective (meaning no two distinct vertices in $G$ are sent to the same vertex (respectively for arrows) under $f$). Does this imply that $\Path(f)$ is also injective (meaning no two distinct paths are sent to the same path under $f$)?
\item Suppose that $f_0$ and $f_1$ are surjective (meaning every vertex in $G'$ and every arrow in $G'$ is in the image of $f$). Does this imply that $\Path(f)$ is also surjective? Hint: at least one of the answers to these three questions is “no”.
