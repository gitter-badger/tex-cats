\chapter{Categories at work}

We have now set up an understanding of the basic notions of category theory: categories, functors, natural transformations, and universal properties. We have discussed many sources of examples: orders, graphs, monoids, and databases. We begin this chapter with the notion of {\em adjoint functors} (also known as {\em adjunctions}), which are like dictionaries that translate back and forth between different categories.
